                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>Outlet Network is an organization that aims to strengthen the creative community by 
                            unifying artists and creative workers into a single space. Our goal is to remove 
                            barriers from artists finding like-minded individuals with the hopes of inspiring 
                            and promoting their hustle. We aim to provide resources and recognition to smaller 
                            artists while sharing the encouraging and exciting stories of larger artists.</p>

                            artists is done through our events where our creative community comes together to 
                            network and support each other. We believe that physical interactions are crucial 
                            towards creating lasting connections and this brings real life impact.</p>
